Scraping dynamic table from the website with Python
Motivation: I moved into a flat where I could hear trains ramble and then I realized that there is an underground railway just beside the flat. The rambling sound is annoying and I want to figure out how often does the train passes by. The live timetable for specific train station is available in the ScotRail offical website as an example shown below:

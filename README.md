# Scraping dynamic table from the website with Python
## Motivation: 

I moved into a flat where I could always hear the rumble of trains, and then I realized that there is an underground railway just next to the flat. The rumbling sound is annoying and I wonder how often the trains passe by. Live timetables for specific train stations can be viewed on the e ScotRail official website as shown below,

## Methods:
In order to scrape the information of the live timetable, I wrote a Python code by using the Selenium library to open the website and scrape data every 10 min from 5:00 - 23:59, Monday to Sunday (code/scrape_timetable.py). Bar charts are generated to visualize how many trains pass each hour per day (code/figure.py)

## Results:


## Conclusion:
